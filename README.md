# CPT-Project-Home-Automation-System

This project simulates a home automation system using Cisco Packet Tracer. The system consists of a home gateway, a thermostat, a light bulb, and a security camera. The home gateway is connected to the internet and provides wireless access for the other devices. The thermostat can be used to control the temperature of the house, the light bulb can be turned on and off, and the security camera can be used to monitor the house.

The system is automated so that the thermostat can adjust the temperature according to the desired setting, the light bulb can turn on and off at certain times, and the security camera can start recording when it detects motion.

The project was created using Cisco Packet Tracer, a network simulator that allows users to create and test network topologies. Packet Tracer is a valuable tool for learning about networking concepts and for developing and testing network configurations.
